Before we begin, I want to let you know that I'm writing a book about Vim, the text editor. It will go into beta later this year, and should be on the shelves by next year. My publishers have generated a coupon code that will give you a 25% discount on any of their titles. If you use this before the 7th of November, then the prags will generate a second coupon when my book becomes available, giving you a discount on it.

So. On to the main session.

I'm Drew Neil. You might recognise my voice if you've watched any of my screencasts on Sencha Touch.
