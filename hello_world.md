##Â Hello World

Now that we've got the Sencha Touch libraries installed and playing nicely with rails, lets quickly run through a Hello World application. In coffeescript.

Here's the app.js file, which initializes a viewport. A few things to note about coffeescript here.

* like python, it uses significant whitespace
* the function keyword is replaced by this dashbang stabby arrow
* the `@` sign is a shorthand for the this keyword

Appart from these syntactical shorthands, the semantics of coffeescript are identical to those of javascript. So I hope you'll follow along.

Here's the code for the viewport, which simply sets up a few default parameters.

And here's what the result looks like in the iphone simulator.
